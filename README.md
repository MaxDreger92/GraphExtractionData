# GraphExtractionData

This data set contains the inputs and outputs for the extraction pipeline of nodes and relationships from tables, using LLMs.
Each extraction was repeated three times to compensate the indeterministic nature of LLMs.
The data set was directly exported from langchain, the single experiments can be made available upon request.
